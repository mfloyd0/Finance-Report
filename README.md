# Finance-Report


In this program you will be prompted to select your bank statement for the previous month and after doing so a template will be made and then the data from the bank statement will be inseted in the proper cells. There will be an excel export at the end that the will have a report of last months transactions grouped and calculated by income, income, bill, debt and variables.

If you plan to use and modify this for yourself then your main focus would be in the Data_Insertion.py file. In there you can configure it to however you want to process the data.
